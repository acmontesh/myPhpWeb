        <p>I am a PhD student at the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering department at the University of Texas at Austin (UT). 
            My research focuses on early detection of drilling abnormalities, such as poor hole cleaning and wellbore instability. 
            This, in turn, is essential for preventing events that generate non productive time (NPT) and significant cost overrun, 
            such as stuck pipe incidents. At UT, I work under the advise of <a href="https://pge.utexas.edu/facultystaff/faculty-directory/vanoort">Dr. Eric 
            van Oort</a> at his research consortium: Rig Automation and Performance Improvement in Drilling (<a href="https://drilling.utexas.edu/">RAPID</a>)

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>My primary interests are associated with the optimization of the drilling process at its various stages, from well planning to 
                the after-action review. My interests include:

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>                    
        <p>As a drilling engineer for eight years, I had the opportunity to work in challenging well construction projects, both at the field and the office team, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deep onshore wells in the Colombian foothills</li>
            <li>Exploratory wells</li>
            <li>Thru-tubing ultra-slim laterals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, I have teaching experience both as a teaching assistant and a professor. I worked as a teaching assistant (TA) for 
            well logging and calculus courses; and taught, as an adjuct professor, in the computer science and engineering department at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. 
            Besides doing research, teaching is one of the things I enjoy the most.
